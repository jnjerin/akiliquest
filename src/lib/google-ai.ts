  TOPIC TO EXPLORE: "${topic}"
  
  Please provide a comprehensive exploration following this EXACT JSON structure:
  
  {
    "summary": "A compelling 2-3 sentence overview that captures the essence and importance of this topic",
    "connections": [
      {
        "title": "Connection Title",
        "description": "Detailed explanation of this connected concept (2-3 sentences)",
        "relationship": "How this connects to the main topic",
        "confidence": 0.95

    ],
    "keywords": ["key", "terms", "related", "to", "topic"],
    "difficulty": "beginner|intermediate|advanced",
    "estimatedReadingTime": 5
  }
  
  REQUIREMENTS:
  1. Generate exactly 5 connections that are:
     - Intellectually stimulating
     - Span different domains when possible
     - Include both obvious and surprising connections
     - Range from practical applications to theoretical concepts
  
  2. Make connections that would genuinely spark curiosity
  3. Ensure descriptions are accessible but not oversimplified
  4. Confidence scores should reflect how strong the connection is (0.7-1.0)
  5. Estimated reading time should be realistic (3-15 minutes)
  
  Focus on creating "aha moments" - connections that make people think "I never thought about it that way!"
  
  Respond ONLY with valid JSON, no additional text.`;

  Find 3 NEW connections that go deeper or explore different angles. Focus on:
  - Advanced applications or implications
  - Historical context or future possibilities  
  - Cross-disciplinary connections
  - Philosophical or ethical dimensions
  
  Respond with the same JSON structure as before, but avoid repeating the already explored connections.`;
